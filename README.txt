This program was proposed as an extra task during a college class.

Keylock besides printing, create a buffer interruption disabling input on dos systems.

It was tested in several DOS-box-like envoirments, after the traffic interruption the program goes into a loop in a section
called wait-for-restart. By doing these two things; buffer interruption and a program loop, it will cause serious operational
problems.

----BE CAREFUL, IF YOU FOR INSTANCE USE ON A REAL DOS MACHINE OR A VIRTUAL DOS MACHINE IT MAY GET YOU STUCK----
when using dos-box, make sure to keep the program minimized, otherwise you will have to restart the hole machine.


-------------CASE YOU GET STUCK, REMEMBER TO HOLD POWER DOWN TO COME BACK---------------------------------
